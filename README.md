PSSpriteEditor
==============

Simple sprite editor for PuzzleScript games.

The editor is all HTML5/CSS-based, so it should run in any HTML5-compatible browser. **However**, the form-based color picker I use is only available in Chrome and Opera. Other browsers will have to enter a manual hex colour value as text.

This code is provided as is, with no support. If you make improvements and would like to share, please send me a pull request.
