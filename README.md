PSSpriteEditor
==============

Simple sprite editor for PuzzleScript games.

The editor is all HTML5/CSS-based, so it should run in any HTML5-compatible browser that can also bring up a colour picker.

This code is provided as is, with no support. If you make improvements and would like to share, please send me a pull request.
